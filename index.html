                            <h4>What Practical Skill Sets Can I Expect To Have Upon Completion Of The Course?</h4>
                            <p>By the end of the course, you will have gained practice in the most used web-based programming language – JavaScript. You’ll have built several full-stack applications of varying complexity, and have experience working with a team in a development environment.</p>
                            <p>You’ll gain confidence in tackling new technologies in an ever-changing field. You’ll have gained foundational skill in many disciplines that touch web development – managing complex data sets, securing your applications with encrypted passwords, and testing and deploying your applications to prepare them to scale.</p>
